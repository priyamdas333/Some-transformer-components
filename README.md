
# Raw GPT Transformer Components

A research-oriented collection of Transformer building blocks implemented from scratch in PyTorch.

This repository is part of my effort to deeply understand the architectural components that power modern Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT, Llama, Gemini, Claude, DeepSeek, and Grok.

Instead of treating Transformers as black boxes, the goal of this project is to study individual components in isolation, understand why they exist, analyze their mathematical foundations, and explore how design choices affect training dynamics, efficiency, and scaling behavior.

---

## Motivation

Modern LLMs are built from a surprisingly small set of recurring ideas:

* Attention mechanisms
* Positional representations
* Feed-forward networks
* Normalization layers
* Residual pathways
* Routing mechanisms (MoE)
* Efficient attention variants

While these components appear simple individually, their interactions determine the capabilities of models with billions or even trillions of parameters.

This repository serves as a personal research sandbox for implementing, analyzing, and experimenting with such components from first principles.

## Repository Goals

* Implement Transformer modules from scratch.
* Develop intuition for architectural design choices.
* Reproduce important ideas from influential papers.
* Study efficiency-performance tradeoffs.
* Build foundations for future LLM research.
* Create reusable components for larger language model projects.

## Research Questions

Some questions I am actively exploring:

### Attention

* Why does attention scale so well?
* How much information is stored in individual heads?
* When do attention heads become redundant?

### Positional Representations

* Why do RoPE-based models outperform absolute positional embeddings?
* What happens at very long context lengths?

### Feed Forward Networks

* Why do MLP layers occupy most parameters in modern LLMs?
* How important are gated activations such as SwiGLU?

### Scaling

* Which Transformer components become bottlenecks at scale?
* What architectural modifications improve inference efficiency?

## Future Experiments

* Reproduce a miniature GPT-style decoder model.
* Train small language models from scratch.
* Compare LayerNorm vs RMSNorm.
* Compare RoPE vs Sinusoidal embeddings.
* Attention head ablation studies.
* MoE routing experiments.
* Long-context architecture investigations.

# GPT-Style Transformer Components

Welcome to **Some-transformer-components**! This repository is dedicated to building the fundamental raw components of a GPT-style (Decoder-only) Transformer model from the ground up. It covers the entire end-to-end pipeline, starting from synthetic data generation all the way to model assembly and training.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project breaks down the complex architecture of a Transformer into understandable, modular, and highly readable Python scripts. It is designed to demonstrate how large language models function under the hood, making it a great resource for understanding attention mechanisms and decoder-only sequential processing.

## 📂 Repository Structure & Components

The repository is modularized into distinct files, each representing a crucial step in the Transformer architecture or the training process:

### 🧠 Core Architecture
* **`Self-attention.py`**: Implements the foundational scaled dot-product self-attention mechanism, allowing the model to weigh the importance of different tokens in a sequence.
* **`Multi-head-attention.py`**: Expands on basic self-attention by projecting queries, keys, and values into multiple "heads," enabling the model to capture various representational subspaces simultaneously.
* **`TransformerBlock.py`**: The standard building block of the decoder network. It integrates the multi-head attention layer with a position-wise feed-forward network, residual connections, and layer normalization.
* **`MiniTransformer.py`**: The overarching model definition. This file strings together the embedding layers, positional encodings, and multiple Transformer blocks, complete with robust parameter checking.

### ⚙️ Data & Training
* **`Synthetic_Repeated_Pattern_Dataset.py`**: A custom data generation module that creates synthetic sequences with repeated patterns. This serves as a lightweight, predictable dataset to test if the model is successfully learning dependencies.
* **`Parameter_Dataset_Model_Initialization.py`**: A centralized configuration script that handles the initialization of all hyperparameters, prepares the synthetic dataset, and initializes the MiniTransformer model.
* **`Training_Pipeline.py`**: The main execution script containing the complete training loop. It manages forward passes, loss calculation, backpropagation, and weight optimization.
